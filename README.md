## The Health Insurance
This project analyses a health insurance dataset to uncover the key factors influencing insurance charges. Using a combination of data cleaning, exploration, and visualisation, the project delivers actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reproducible workflows.

### objectives
* Build a reliable ETL pipeline to clean and standardise the raw insurance dataset.

* Explore and analyse how demographic and lifestyle factors (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region) impact insurance charges.

* Create derived variables such as age_bracket, and bmi_category, to support deeper insights.

* ### Identify outliers and anomalies in medical charges and BMI.

* Test hypotheses (e.g., Do smokers pay more?, Does BMI drive costs?, Are there regional differences?).

* Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI for storytelling and exploration.

## Dataset Content

we have to Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size of 100Gb.
The dataset includes 1,338 records with the following columns:

age ‚Äì Age of the insured individual

sex ‚Äì Gender (male/female)

bmi ‚Äì Body Mass Index, a measure of weight relative to height

children ‚Äì Number of dependents covered by insurance

smoker ‚Äì Smoking status (yes/no)

region ‚Äì Geographic region of residence (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)

charges ‚Äì Individual medical insurance charges billed


## Business Requirements

The business requires a comprehensive analysis of health insurance charges to identify the main factors driving costs and to support data-driven decision-making.

üîπ Business Needs

Understand Cost Drivers

Identify demographic and lifestyle factors (age, BMI, smoker and non smoker, region, dependents) that significantly influence insurance charges.

Segmentation of Policyholders

Group customers into categories (e.g., by smoking status, BMI category, age band, and charges band) to enable better risk profiling.

Outlier Detection

Flag unusually high or low charges and BMI values that may indicate anomalies, errors, or exceptional cases requiring review.

Interactive Dashboards

Provide visual dashboards that allow stakeholders to filter, drill down, and compare groups (e.g., smokers vs non-smokers, male vs female, regions).

Documentation & Reproducibility

Ensure that all data transformations, calculations, and insights are documented for transparency and future maintainability.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

The project explores several hypotheses about the drivers of health insurance charges. Each hypothesis will be validated through visual analysis, and comparisons in dashboards.

Hypothesis 1: Smokers incur higher charges than non-smokers

Validation:

Compare average charges of smokers vs non-smokers using bar charts.

Visualise with boxplots to show spread and outliers.

Hypothesis 2: BMI is positively correlated with charges

Validation:

Calculate correlation coefficient between bmi and charges.

Create a scatter plot (BMI vs charges) with smoker as a color dimension to highlight differences.

Optionally fit a regression line to measure effect size.

Hypothesis 3: Older individuals have higher insurance charges

Validation:

Group policyholders by age_bracket.

Compare average charges across age bracket with column charts.

Hypothesis 4: Charges vary by region

Validation:

Use bar charts to compare average charges per region.

Map visualisation to highlight geographic variation.

Hypothesis 5: Number of dependents (children) impacts charges

Validation:

Plot column chart of charges by number of children.

Run regression analysis including children as an explanatory variable.

Compare distributions across families of different sizes.

## Hypothesis 6: Outliers distort average charges

Validation:

## Identify outliers in charges and bmi using the IQR method.

## Recalculate averages with and without outliers.

## Provide dashboard toggles/slicers (is_outlier_charges = False) to explore their effect interactively.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
| **Business Requirement**                                              | **Visualisation(s)**                                                   | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Understand **cost drivers** (smoker, sex, region, BMI, age, children) | **Bar Charts / Column Charts** (Average charges per category)          | Bar/column charts make it easy to compare average charges across categories (e.g., smoker vs non-smoker, male vs female, by region). They highlight which groups drive higher costs. |
| Explore **distribution of charges**                                   | **Histogram / KDE Plot** (Seaborn)                                     | Distribution plots reveal skewness, spread, and the presence of heavy tails in charges, helping to categorise into low, medium, and high bands.                                      |
| Detect **outliers** in charges and BMI                                | **Box Plots** (Seaborn / Plotly)                                       | Boxplots clearly show median, quartiles, and extreme values, making it easy to identify unusual policyholders that may distort averages.                                             |
| Analyse **relationships between variables**                           | **Scatter Plots** (Charges vs BMI, Charges vs Age)                     | Scatter plots highlight correlations and trends, especially when colour-coded by smoker status. Interactive versions (Plotly) allow deeper inspection.                               |
| Provide **segmentation of policyholders**                             | **Stacked Column Charts / Treemap**                                    | Segmenting by BMI category, age band, or smoker status shows population distribution and supports risk profiling.                                                                    |
| Enable **interactive exploration**                                    | **Plotly Express Interactive Charts**, **Power BI/Tableau Dashboards** | Interactive visuals allow filtering, zooming, and drilling down by region, smoker, or age band, ensuring insights are accessible to both technical and business users.               |
| Ensure **transparent documentation**                                  | **Matplotlib Baseline Bar Charts & Seaborn Distributions**             | Using static, reproducible plots in Python ensures results can be documented in notebooks and compared with interactive dashboards for consistency.                                  |

How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
üîπ Data Privacy
The dataset used (insurance.csv) is publicly available from Kaggle and contains synthetic data, not real patient records.

No personally identifiable information (PII) is included, so risks to individual privacy are minimal.

Compliance: Since no real personal health data was processed, regulations like GDPR is not directly applicable.

üîπ Bias and Fairness

The dataset includes demographic categories (sex, age, region, smoker and non smoker).

Risk of sampling bias: The dataset may not represent the true population distribution of health insurance customers.

Potential for interpretation bias: Conclusions (e.g., smokers pay 4√ó more) may oversimplify real-world scenarios where socioeconomic and healthcare access factors also play roles.

üîπ Legal Issues

Dataset is open-source under Kaggle‚Äôs license ‚Üí safe to use for educational and research purposes.

No confidential insurance company data was accessed.

All code, reports, and dashboards follow open-source best practices for transparency and reproducibility.


## Dashboard Design
List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences.


## Unfixed Bugs
Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.
